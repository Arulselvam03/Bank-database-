The same account has drawn money of 500 on 2012-08-12 , 500 on 2012-09-15, 1000 on 2012-12-17. So balance amount is 4000 i.e (1000 (opening balance)+2000+3000 )   (500+500+1000).

				C00012 Took a loan of 500000 from bank branch with id B00010. 
				So total loan amount for customer C00012 is 600000. 

				C00013 took a loan of 100000 from bank branch B00009 and 200000 from bank branch B00011.
				So total loan taken is 300000. 


				So loan taken by C00012 is more then C00013.
